# FileSorter
App listens to specified directory and moves files to specified directories by file extension.
In this console app ui you can set new source or destination directories. Just remember to build the project after changes.

The advantage of this app lies in sorting big amount of different kind of files really fast. In example, the app could listen browser's downloads folder. App can sort files in own directories (which may locate in onedrive or in other web storage). This way the files are transferred quickly and they're easily accessable. Source folder has timer, so the frequency of transfers can be aligned for the needs.
